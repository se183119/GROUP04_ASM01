# Smoking Cessation Support Platform - Transformation Complete

## Overview
This project successfully transforms the existing hotel management system into a comprehensive smoking cessation support platform while maintaining the original 3-layer architecture pattern.

## Architecture
The platform follows the same proven 3-layer architecture:
- **BusinessObjects**: Entity models and data structures
- **DataAccessObjects**: Data access layer with interfaces and implementations  
- **Repositories**: Repository pattern implementation
- **WPF UI**: User interface layer with role-based views

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Role-Based User System
- **Guest**: Browse platform features, view success stories
- **Member**: Access paid features, track progress, create quit plans
- **Coach**: Provide consultation and support to members
- **Admin**: Manage platform, users, and generate reports

### 2. Comprehensive Data Model
**New Business Entities:**
- `User` (enhanced Customer) with role-based access
- `MembershipPackage` for subscription management
- `SmokingStatus` for tracking current smoking habits
- `QuitPlan` for personalized cessation plans
- `ProgressLog` for daily progress tracking
- `Achievement` and `Badge` for gamification
- `Notification` for motivation system
- `CoachSession` for professional support
- `CommunityPost` for social features
- `Rating` for feedback system

### 3. Modern User Interface
**Dashboard System:**
- **Guest Dashboard**: Platform introduction, features showcase, success stories
- **Member Dashboard**: Progress overview, quick actions, statistics
- **Coach Dashboard**: Session management, member oversight, performance metrics
- **Admin Dashboard**: Platform management (uses existing AdminWindow)

**Registration System:**
- Multi-step registration process
- Membership package selection
- Initial smoking profile setup
- Form validation and error handling

### 4. Database Schema
Complete SQL schema (`SmokingCessationPlatform.sql`) includes:
- All new tables with proper relationships
- Default membership packages
- Sample achievements
- Admin and coach accounts
- Foreign key constraints and indexes

### 5. Data Access Layer
**Complete CRUD Operations:**
- DAO interfaces and implementations for all entities
- Repository pattern with business logic
- Specialized queries for smoking cessation features
- Error handling and validation

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Highlights
```sql
-- User table with role-based access
Customer (enhanced with Role, MembershipPackageID, etc.)

-- Core smoking cessation tables
SmokingStatus (tracks current habits)
QuitPlan (personalized cessation plans)  
ProgressLog (daily tracking)
Achievement & Badge (gamification)
Notification (motivation system)
CoachSession (professional support)
CommunityPost (social features)
Rating (feedback system)
```

### Key Classes and Patterns
```csharp
// Role-based enum
public enum UserRole { Guest, Member, Coach, Admin }

// Enhanced user entity
public partial class Customer
{
    // Original properties...
    public UserRole Role { get; set; }
    public int? MembershipPackageId { get; set; }
    // Navigation properties for new features...
}

// Repository pattern example
public class SmokingStatusRepository : ISmokingStatusRepository
{
    private readonly ISmokingStatusDAO _smokingStatusDao;
    // CRUD operations with business logic
}
```

### UI Architecture
- **Role-based navigation**: Login system routes users to appropriate dashboards
- **Session management**: User data stored in Application.Current.Resources
- **Modern design**: Consistent branding and responsive layouts
- **Step-by-step processes**: Multi-step registration with validation
